<br>
<H2>Brushes Tools</H2>
Brushes tools are based on grescale images<br>
The default tools availables are based on replication of the SC4 ingame terraforming tools<br>
You can add brush tool by modifying the <b>Brushes.py</b> file. See the information in this file to know how to add/modify brushes tools

<H2>Modding textures</H2>
<p class=color_code_instructions>
Here is a list of textures you can change to make SC4Terraform pleasant to you eyes.
<ul>
<li><b>Water.bmp</b>, is the translucent texture used for water
<li><b>Wired.bmp</b>, is the texture used for showing grid, if you change it, leave a 2 pixel black border or the grid won't show
<li><b>Detail.bmp</b>, is the noise texture applied to the ground
</ul>
<p class=color_code_instructions>
If you are familiar with <b>HLSL</b> you can tweak the 3 <b>.fx</b> files. If you are familiar then you don't need information on what to do with them. If you don't know what to do with them, then you're obviously not familiar, so I'd advise you to not touch them.<br>
</p>
<a name="colors"/>
<H2>Changing Colors</H2>
<p class=color_code_instructions>
The default coloration is stored in a file called <b>basicColors.ini</b> in the program directory, which is loaded at run time. You can make your own coloration by copying the basicColors.ini to another file and editing it in a text editor such as NOTEPAD. In SC4Terraformer you can load the new coloration file by clicking the 'Change Colors' button and selecting the new coloration file.
<br>
<br>
The guide below explains the contents of the coloration file and how to edit it:
<br>
<br>
The file contains 3 sections:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land
<br>
<br>
"background" is a single color and does not vary. You may set it to any color that pleases you. The DEFAULT is color = FF2F88 (recall that the HTML color codes are found from the reference web sites. Since the presentation is done in HTML <b>you should LOOK UP the color code from one of the <a href="#req">reference sites</a></b>) For those who are interested, this last number is a HEXIDECIMAL TRIPLET representing the RGB VALUES for the color selected.
<br>
<br>
"water" and "land" both SET THE COLOR of SPECIFIC altitudes above or below water level.
<br>
<br>
Numbers IN BETWEEN these depths are INTERPOLATED (that is shaded in a smooth gradient) between the colors.
<br>
<br>
Looking at an entry, you can see this is done with number pairs such as "200 = 00084A"
<br>
<br>
This means that at 200 meters BELOW water level the color is 00084A. <b>NOTE: Do not add a negative sign to the water.. it is implied to be below water.</b> You will see that the default for water is only shaded from 0 to 200 meters below water.. all deeper water is the same color (00084A). WHY? because the color at 200 AND at 6000 are BOTH THE SAME, therefore interpolation gives the same color regardless of depth. You could change this of course if you wished.
<br>
<br>
"land" is done in the same way as "water" with pairs of numbers such as "100 = 00CE00". This means that at the height of 100 meters, the color will be "00CE00" (again recall, you have to look these up at a reference site as given above). Each added pair of numbers set the color at added heigths. The next color is "200 = 189C18". This means that at height 200, the color will be 189C18. From 100 to 200 colors are INTERPOLATED again smoothly across the range of "in between" colors.
<br>
<br>
By changing these "color points" you can affect exactly the color-to-height-mapping that is pleasing to you. This also allows you to modify the color to nicely represent your own personal terrain habits. If you have lots of altitude across your region, you can choose a full range of colors, but if your maps are rarely more than say 1000 meters across a region, you may choose to have much finer color ranges to see your variations more easily.

<H2>Adding universal tools</H2>
<p class=color_code_instructions style="margin-bottom:5px;">
With <b>v.08c</b> comes a way for you to create your own tools. These tools can be found in the Universal Tools section of the toolbar.<br>
<br>
Tools are shapes defined by a spline (a curve that passes through predefined points).<br>
The shape is revolved around the center of the tool (ie the red point)<br>
The curve is defined from the center to the outer circumference, with a height modification to apply to the terrain<br>
The curve is defined in the interval [0,1], where 0 represents the red point (center), and 1 means the outer radius of the tool<br>
In the file <b>tools.ini</b>, you define a tool by creating a new section then you define some control points for where the curve should pass through
</p>
<pre style="margin-left:30px;margin-top:3px;margin-bottom:5px;">
[Hill]
0=1
0.7=0.9
1=0
</pre>
<p class=color_code_instructions style="margin-top:3px;">
Here we have defined a tool that will cause elevation changes at the distances 0 (0%), 0.7 (70%), and 1 (100%) from the center to the radius.<br>
So at center (0%) it will raise the terrain 1m (1), at 70% of the radius it will raise the terrain .9m (0.9) and at 100% of the radius there will be no change (0). This tool will make a hill<br>
To avoid perfect symmetry you can also add the following options:<br>
<ul style="margin-top:3px;margin-bottom:3px;margin-left:50px;">
<li>perturbHeight = min,max &nbsp;&nbsp;<i style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:9pt;">Specifies a random variation of a height of any point to avoid symmetry. The Min and Max values determine a range for the random values.</i>
<li>perturbRadius = min,max &nbsp;&nbsp;<i style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:9pt;">Specifies a random variation of a point from the center to avoid symmetry. The Min and Max values determine a range for the random values.</i>
<li>scaleFactor = radius &nbsp;&nbsp;<i style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:9pt;">Specifies that the bigger the tool, the greater the change in elevation</i>
</ul>
<p class=color_code_instructions style="margin-top:3px;">
<br>
Wow, a wealth of information there. So let's go over it now to make sure we didn't miss anything<br>
<table width=80% border=0 valign=top>
<tr valign=top>
<td><b style="font-size:9pt;">[Hill]</b><td>-<td><i style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:9pt;">The name of the new tool</i>
<tr valign=top>
<td><b style="font-size:9pt;">0=1</b><td>-<td><i style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:9pt;">At 0% distance from radius, height will change by 1m</i>
<tr valign=top>
<td><b style="font-size:9pt;">.7=.9</b><td>-<td><i style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:9pt;">At 70% distance from radius, height will change by 0.9m. NOTE: Positive values are an increase in height, and negative values are a decrease in height.</i>
<tr valign=top>
<td><b style="font-size:9pt;">1=0</b><td>-<td><i style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:9pt;">At 100% distance from radius, height will change by 0m.</i>
</table>
<table width=80% border=0 valign=top>
<tr valign=top>
<td><b style="font-size:9pt;">perturbHeight=Min,Max</b><td>-<td><i style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:9pt;">Specifies Minimum and Maximum values for a random multiplier that changes height values to avoid perfect symmetry</i>
<tr valign=top>
<td><b style="font-size:9pt;">perturbRadius=Min,Max</b><td>-<td><i style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:9pt;">Specifies Minimum and Maximum values for a random multiplier that changes distance from radius values to avoid perfect symmetry</i>
<tr valign=top>
<td><b style="font-size:9pt;">scaleFactor=radius</b><td>-<td><i style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:9pt;">Specifies that the tool's intensity will vary with it's radius</i>
</table>
<br>
As you might be able to tell, it'll take a couple of trial and errors to get this right. Just try something and see what it does. Experiment.
<br>
<br>
For your benefit, here is a full example, it creates a kind of V shape (hence the name Canyon) with a small amount of raise at the border to make a smooth hill at the top of the canyon<br>
The strength will be a function of the radius, and the tool is perturbed in both height and radius<br>
<pre style="margin-left:25px;margin-top:7px;">
[Canyon]
0 = -2
0.5 = -1.9
0.8 = -0.9
0.85 = 0.1
0.9 = 0.15
0.95 = 0
1 = 0
perturbHeight = .75,1
perturbRadius = .85,1.15
scaleFactor = radius

<H1>FAQs</H2>
<ul style="font-weight:bold">
<li><font color=purple>This sucks, everything is lagging as hell</font>
<ol class=answer>SC4Terraformer is quite CPU and GFX intensive</ol>
<li><font color=purple>Ok this lag, how can I speed up a bit?</font>
<ol class=answer>Turn off water rendering, turn off shadows, turn on show city borders, unlock any cities (<b>relock them before saving</b>), move the camera so it looks down. In short, the less you see, the faster it will be</ol>
<li><font color=purple>What is the SC4M file for?</font>
<ol class=answer>I hope that one day, we can exchange region with full elevation range using this file format.</ol>
<li><font color=purple>How can I prevent the program to pop the readme everytime I run it?</font>
<ol class=answer>Rename the Readme.html to another name</ol>
<li><font color=purple>Why is the draw tool drawing at the same height as harbor tool even if I put 1000m in the height?</font>
<ol class=answer>You should press <b>Enter</b> after entering the desired height. The draw height is reflected in the status bar</ol>
<li><font color=purple>How do I change the background color and/or the terrain colors?</font>
<ol class=answer>
Instructions can be found <a href="#colors">here</a>.
</ol>
<li><font color=purple>Why do I see borders on the terrain in the region view in SC4 even if I uncheck borders?</font>
<ol class=answer>
You have saved your region in the Terraformer while the 'show city border' option is checked. Try a resave with city borders off.
</ol>
<li><font color=purple>I have a big region, but I want to crop it to make a smaller one. Is it possible?</font>
<ol class=answer>
You can export your region as 16bit greyscale png, then using your image editor, you can crop the interesting part, and reimport the new 16bit png in a new region.<br>
BTW, you can with the same technique arrange multiple regions.
</ol>
<li><font color=purple>What is the mean of parameters for the Import Dialog?</font>
<ol class=answer>
They are parameters to convert from greyscale to SC4 units ( ie meters )
<ul>
<li>The scale factor is how much 1 unit in the greyscale image represent in SC4, you can enter a number or choose from the predefined one
</ul>
</ol>
<li><font color=purple>So why I if change the parameters and load a 16bit png or a SC4M or a TER the region is still the same ?</font>
<ol class=answer>
Thoses parameters are only used when you import a 8bit greyscale or RGB picture
</ol>
<li><font color=purple>Why SC4TF ask me for an HTML when I export to SC4M?</font>
<ol class=answer>
This html ( the source code of it ) will be included into the SC4M, as the config.bmp and will be displayed on import.
</ol>

<span class=code>
To test it:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Run a console window (start->run->cmd.exe)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the installed folder (C:\program files\SC4Terraformer by default)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the prompt, type <b>convertisoline.exe iso2.bmp</b> or any image that is like iso2.bmp
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It will run output some intrigated messages, and on finish will try to show you the result
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is saved as temp.bmp in the installation folder
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can then import this image in SC4Terraformer or directly in SC4.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The iso2.bmp is made for 8x6 region
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid any weird feedback, this is the first run and still need work, mainly isoclines need to be closed or touching border, if you have hole in isocline result maybe strange
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You also may need to do some post effect in any image editor

<span class=code>
<br>
To test it:
<br>
Create a new folder in your My documents\simcity 4\regions\ and copy the region.ini and config.bmp in it.

Launch SC4Terraformer and load that region, and specify 135 as waterlevel

Import the Genesus.SC4M

The region should be ok.

<li>ABOUT BOX added  
<li>CITY LOCKER/UNLOCKER : 
<span class=code>
<br>
When you load the city, the config.bmp ( reworked for better coloring ) and a list of existing savegame will be shown. You can lock or unlock those cities for terraforming  you can unlock/lock city after doing some terraformning ( in the Configuration Tools panel ). If you lock a city after having done some terraforming it will revert to the original elevation  using the zones tools on a lock city works until you release the mouse, all changes are discarded ( this is for speed reasons )

Unsaved city can not be locked (even if it is displayed as locked )

<li>CITY SAVING
<span class=code>
<br>
If you have locked the city, it won't save

<li>UNSAVED CITY   
<span class=code>
<br>
Identified by the config.bmp
<br>
Unsaved cities are created 30m above the waterLevel
<br>
Unsaved cities can not be locked (even if it is displayed as locked )
<br>
SC4Terraformer will create a savegame for the city
<br>
IMPORTANT NOTE if you don't want to loose the newly created city, when in SC4 you should start a new city and save it ( go to mayor mod and save ). If you save before entering mayor mod, there will be lost of data in your region
<br>
<br>
</span>  
<li>YOU CAN NOW CREATE A NEW REGION FROM SC4TERRAFORMER :
<ul>
<li>Step 1 : 
  Create a region folder in your MyDocuments\SimCity 4\Regions folder  and named the way you like
<li>Step 2 : 
  Copy a region.ini from any other existing region  
<li>Step 3 :
  Open the region.ini and change the name to the one you choose and save
<li>Step 4 :
  Create or get a config.bmp ( should be valid from SC4 point of view ) and save it in the new folder
<li>Step 5 : 
  Launch SC4Terraformer and select the new folder
<li>Step 6 : 
  Either import or not an image ( must have the correct size ie (64 * size of bmp) + 1 in width and height )
<li>Step 7 : 
  Do hand terraforming
<li>Step 8 :
  Save & quit
<li>Step 9 :
  Launch SC4 and load the new region
<li>Step 10: -------------- IMPORTANT --------------
  For each city tile, load it, go in mayor mod ( name your city uniquely ) and save    !!!!!
<li>I havn't still discovered the good way to tell if a city is built or not ( that means have you entered in Mayor mod or not )
SO CHECK CORRECTLY the lock/unlock dialog !

2.4 is the original maxis value, and 3 is the one use by CD columbus mod.
